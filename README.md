Neural Networks repo contain variety examples of neural networks and their optimisation.
- LSTM tunning Dropout MaxPooling
- Neural Network in compare to classic ML.
- NeuralNetwork Simple
- Text Classification Keras Embeddings
- Slowly but surely i will add more on different architectures and their tunning (CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, Transfer, GANs, maybe Boltzman Machines)

This repositori is in progress and I aim to add more neural networks in future, make more structure and resources material from common parts (templates, tooklit).
