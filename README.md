### Neural Networks
Variety examples of neural networks and their optimisation as:
- LSTM tunning with Dropout and MaxPooling
- Text Classification Keras Embeddings
- Simple Neural Network example
- Neural Network in compare to classic ML.
- Slowly but surely i will add more on different architectures and their tunning (CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, Transfer, GANs, maybe Boltzman Machines)

This repository is in progress and I aim to add more neural networks in future, make more structure and resources material from common parts (templates, tooklit).

Libraries in use: mostly Keras, some sklearn, numpy, TensorFlow.
